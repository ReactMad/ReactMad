 Hi, Iâ€™m Uros ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Developer from Serbia, who has hands-one experience with client facing applications development.
In the past 5 years I worked on various website and project, mainly with React, Next.js, Gatsby, Prismic, Strapi, GraphQL and Angular.

Right now I am looking forward the great place where I can dedicate my self.
